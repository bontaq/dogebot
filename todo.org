- Note taken on [2014-11-26 Wed 11:25] \\
  Due to how soundcloud resolves users for messages, I think users
  would be confused or accidentally tip the wrong person.
  Bring it back if you can think of a nice way to work around that.

  This will work for a good while, might eventually need to change
  it to going over transactions until the last one we processed is found

  Yep, sending messages matches on display name.  This won't do, could easily send messages to the wrong user
