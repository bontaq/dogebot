A doge tipbot for soundcloud!  It's very much in Alpha/Gamma/Beta so don't be too surprised.

Basic requirements: postgres, rabbitmq, celery, python, pip, dogecoind

Then just do the ol' pip install -r requirements.txt in your virtualenv and see what goes wrong.

To those who write fun stuff involving soundcloud, the best part of this is that I found a way to get mentions from their API.  Checkout my commit on https://github.com/bontaq/soundcloud-python if you'd like to do it too.
